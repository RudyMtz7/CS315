		*/

		/*
		TODO: Set the spinSpeed value so that the speed the ball spins depends on the speed
		of the swipe motion. This is going to be related to the length of the swipe vector and
		the amount of time that has passed between moouseDown and this moment. You can get the
		current elapsed time from the clock using clock.getElapsedTime(). Do this in the mouseDown
		function. Read the docs for how to use getDelta. The spin speed will need
		some adjusting to yield usable values for rotation, so divide it by a suitable value to
		get it small enough.
    https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Clock
    Also, if the swipe vector is zero or very short, the ball's 
    behavior can appear jumpy. I recommend setting the spinSpeed only if the swipe
    vector is some reasonable length (around 20 units worked best for me).
    
    The ball will sometimes appear to jump a little bit when the axis is changed. Think
    about why this is. You do not have to solve this problem here, but it is not too
    difficult to solve.
